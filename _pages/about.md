***<span style="color:orange">Mohsen Saroughi</span>*** (was born ***<span style="color:orange">July 14, 1996</span>***, in ***<span style="color:orange">Sananndaj, Kurdestan, Iran</span>***) is an Iranian researcher specializing in the field of ***<span style="color:orange">Water Science and Engineering - water resources management and groundwater</span>***. Saroughi completed his secondary education in ***<span style="color:YellowGreen">Mathematics-Physics</span>*** major at ***<span style="color:YellowGreen">Soleiman Khater</span>*** High School, ***<span style="color:YellowGreen">Sananndaj, Iran</span>***, graduating in ***<span style="color:YellowGreen">September, 2014</span>***. He earned his ***<span style="color:Tomato">B.Sc.</span>*** in ***<span style="color:Tomato">Water Science and Engineering</span>*** from ***<span style="color:Tomato">Bu-Ali Sina University (2014–2018)</span>*** and ***<span style="color:LawnGreen">M.Sc.</span>*** in ***<span style="color:LawnGreen">Water Resource Management (specializing in groundwater management)</span>*** from the ***<span style="color:LawnGreen">University of Tehran (2018–2021)</span>***. His master’s thesis, titled ***<span style="color:HotPink">"Sustainable Groundwater Management Framework in Arid Zones (Case Study: Rafsanjan, Kerman, Iran)"</span>*** was supervised by ***<span style="color:HotPink">Prof. Majid Kholghi</span>*** and advised by ***<span style="color:HotPink">Prof. Abdolhossein Hoorfar</span>***. His graduate work focused on ***<span style="color:HotPink">groundwater modeling and management methods</span>***.

Saroughi has ***<span style="color:Fuchsia">collaborated</span>*** with ***<span style="color:Fuchsia">both national and international</span>*** partners. He co-authored research with colleagues at University of Tehran and with international experts on cross-country groundwater modeling projects. These collaborations have spanned topics like ***<span style="color:DeepPink">hybrid modeling of AI models for prediction of groundwater levels, runoff, evaporation</span>*** and ***<span style="color:DeepPink">comparative studies of algorithm performance</span>***.

## <span style="color:red">Highlights</span>
* ***<span style="color:Coral">Reviewer</span>*** some M.Sc. and Ph.D. thesis
* ***<span style="color:Coral">Thesis coordinator</span>*** of 5 M.Sc thesis
* Be chosen as ***<span style="color:Coral">researching and teaching assistant</span>*** by two professors
* Be ***<span style="color:Coral">recommended as expert</span>*** for IT and computer working by IRAN WRMC and some high-tech company
